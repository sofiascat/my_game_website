# Image Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder files for images that would be used in a real deployment.

## Required Images

1. **snake_thumbnail.jpg** - A thumbnail image for the Snake game (recommended size: 300x200px)
2. **balloon_popper_thumbnail.jpg** - A thumbnail image for the Balloon Popper game (recommended size: 300x200px)
3. **hero-bg.jpg** - A background image for the hero section (recommended size: 1920x1080px)

## Adding Real Images

Before deploying to GitHub Pages, replace these placeholder files with real images of the appropriate sizes and formats.

For example:
- Use a screenshot of your Snake game for the snake thumbnail
- Use a colorful image with balloons and a bird for the Balloon Popper thumbnail
- Use a gaming-related background image for the hero section

Make sure to keep the same filenames to maintain compatibility with the HTML files.
